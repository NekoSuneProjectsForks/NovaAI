"""NovaAI - shared response-generation engine.

A single place that turns an input (from chat, Twitch, or a game agent) into a
reply, regardless of source. It orchestrates the LLM call in ``chat.py`` plus
lightweight emotion/danger tagging used to drive the avatar.

It deliberately performs **no** side effects: it does not append history, push
to the frontend, or speak. Callers own those concerns so each source (chat,
stream, game) can react differently.
